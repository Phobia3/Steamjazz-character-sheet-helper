Hanseburg is a small but very wealthy state neighbouring both
Victora and Wulffgart. Hanseburg managed to remain neutral
during the 80 Year War, trading with both countries and, when
necessary, occasionally granting them free passage through
their lands. This has led to close knit but cool relations with
both countries. Hanseburg is the centre of trade in Erthair, and
many rich merchants from other countries have chosen do
deposit their wealth to Hanseburgian banks for safekeeping,
which has made Hanseburg the major banking nation in Erthair.
This extraordinary position has made this small country
possibly the richest nation in Erthair, which also reflects on the
living conditions of her people.
The people of Hanseburg come from both Wulffgartian and
Victoran roots. Some citizens are not of Hanseburgian ancestry,
and some come old Hanseburgian families spanning many
generations. Hanseburgians are usually a little shorter than the
tall Wulffgartians and usually a bit more robust of frame than
the slender Victoran people. Hanseburgians have fair skin and
blue, gray or brown eyes. Their hair colour ranges from blond
and gold through dark browns and red hues to deep black.
