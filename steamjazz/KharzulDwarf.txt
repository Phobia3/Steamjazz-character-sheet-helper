These short and stout people originate from the northern
mountains of Wulffgart. They are the descendants of people
who lived in an old mining town of Kharzul. Almost 200 years
ago a source of radiation present in the area started to change
the people. Children were born shorter and more muscular, and
grew up to have broader shoulders than their parents.
Nowadays this robust race of mutants inhabits the city of
Kharzul and the nearby regions, operating the mines and
factories there. They usually have dark brown or reddish hair
and fair or tanned skin. They have wide chins and strong brows.
Many male Kharzul Dwarves have disfigured chins, so big,
chin-covering beards are in fashion. Kharzul chin disfigurement
also causes bad bite, which causes headache. They are usually
skilled in mechanics, and some of the most famous master
smiths come from amongst them. Kharzul Dwarves and
humans can reproduce, but their children are always born with
the Kharzul Dwarves mutation.
