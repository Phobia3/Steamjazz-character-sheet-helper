Goliaths were originally mutants created in Wulffgartian war
laboratories during the 80 Year War as an attempt to create
super soldiers. They were mutated from humans who already
possessed great strength and constitution. Drugs and mutagens
were used to enhance their muscle mass and size, but as a side
effect, their intellect suffered from this treatment. As the war
ended, Wulffgart officially announced that these laboratories
were shut down, and no more goliaths would be made. Still,
some youngsters and children with goliath-like abilities have
been detected. Wulffgartian scientists claim that the parents of
these children must have been exposed to the now-banned
combat drugs during the war, now causing mutations in the
foetus. Goliaths are considerably larger than normal humans,
growing to be over 2.5 meters tall and having massive body
structure. They are strong and tough, but their intellect rarely
reaches the human average. All goliaths are sterile.
