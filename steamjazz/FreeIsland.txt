The Free Islands is the only democratic republic in Erthair. It is
a very young country, having gained its independence at the
end of the 80 Year War. This is strongly reflected in the lives of
those who have been born and raised here.
Many call the Free Islands the land of opportunities and the
land of freedom. Those with the skill and cunning can make
their fortunes among the Isles, for here a person’s success is not
measured by their heritage or social class but by their ability to
seize the opportunity. The educational system and health care
on the Free Islands are still taking their baby steps and aren’t
equally available to everyone. The concept of freedom can be a
double-edged sword too, as the weak are often abused and
tyrannised by those strong enough to take the law is still much
in their own hands.
The Free Islands consists of nine islands, all of which have their
own history and culture. For this reason, people of the Free
Islands are varying both in appearance and in their customs.
Some things, however, are common to all of them: their way of
seizing the opportunity, their tendency to look toward the future
rather than clinging to old traditions and their desire for
freedom, both as groups and as individuals.
People of the Free Islands come from all races and
backgrounds, and their appearance mirrors the appearance of all
people in Erthair.
