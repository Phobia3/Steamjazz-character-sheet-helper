Basic automatons are just what it says on the tin, the archetype
of human-shaped automatons from which most of the more
specialized models were derived. However, this doesn't mean
that basic automatons are useless or obsolete; on the contrary,
not being specialised in any single purpose by design makes
them the most flexible and well-rounded of the various builds.
By default, a basic automaton is ‘naked’ - it has no synthetic
skin, decorative covering or heavy armor - thus showcasing its
biomechanical clockwork imitation of muscle structure.
However, there are plenty of options to choose from when it
comes to customizing the basic archetype, ranging from
humanlike skin and ceramic decorative plates to armor plating.
The basic automaton archetypes are produced in large numbers
and are therefore utilised in many areas of life where a large
workforce is needed, ranging from factory labour to guard
duties. Given that they are such a common sight and are
considered property and not people, it is extremely easy for a
basic archetype with an installed CIC to blend into society - but
feeling like fitting in is an altogether different challenge.
