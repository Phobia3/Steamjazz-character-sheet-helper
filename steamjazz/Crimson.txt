The Crimson Empire is an isolated country in the southeastern
part of the continent. Except for some trade and border
skirmishes with Kheiman, Crimson people have lived in
isolation from other nations for a long time, until very recently
the Two Dragon Port was opened for trade and travellers from
other countries. Most Crimson people lead a life without
contact with other nations. Few would ever try to wander to
foreign lands, for leaving the country without orders from the
Emperor or shogun is punishable by exile from the Crimson
Empire for the rest of one’s life. All Crimson people are
followers of one of three ways: the Way of the Land, the Way
of the White Dragon and the Way of the Black Dragon. These
bear some resemblance to the class systems in other countries.
The Crimson Empire uses money only when trading with other
countries, and all domestic trade is conducted as barter.
For the people of Crimson Empire the meaning behind names is
more important than their form and can be carried over
different languages. This is why they translate the names of
places for foreigners, and in most Victoran-made maps the
names are written in Victoran. Also, this is why most of the
people of the Way of the White Dragon translate their own
names for foreigners and monks of the Black Dragon adopt a
descriptive new monk name for the rest of their lives.
The people of the Crimson Empire are shorter than people of
other nationalities. They usually have coal black or very dark
brown hair and tanned skin. They are more slender of build
than people of the north and Kheiman. Their eyes are usually
brown, but very rarely a child is born with green eyes. They are
thought to be descendants of the dragons, and both Ways of the
Dragons look eagerly for these children for their ranks.
