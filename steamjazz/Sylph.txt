Sylphs are a group of people living in the northern mountains
of the Crimson Empire. It is unknown when the mutations
began, but Sylphs have been around for several centuries at
least. Due to their extraordinary appearance, they live mostly
isolated from the people of the Crimson Empire, although lately
some of the younger Sylphs have headed off to see the world.
Mutagenic radiation seems to be strong in the region, and the
mountains where Sylphs live are constantly shadowed by a
thick cloud cover. Sylphs are very slim, weighing much less
than average humans, and they are usually a bit taller than the
people of the Crimson Empire. Their skin is very fair, and they
have blonde, white or silvery hair. Sylphs have more fragile
bones than normal humans, although their bones are more
flexible. They are usually dextrous and can jump higher than
humans, which makes Sylphs naturally acrobatic. They can
perform extraordinary feats of dexterity, but their raw strength
doesn’t quite match that of humans. It is not known whether
Sylphs can reproduce with humans; at least to this day there are
no known offspring from such relationships.
