Craftsman automatons have been designed by craftsmen to aid
craftsmen. They are equipped with mechanisms and functions
honed for fine precision work and programmed with knowledge
on the desired fields. Even the basic Craftsmen are capable
enough to work as machine shop aids and autonomous nurses,
while ones equipped with Crystal Intelligence Clockwork can,
depending on circumstances, become engineers and even
inventors.
Craftsmen have great variety in their physical appearance.
While common workshop workers look like basic bulk
automatons without fancy decor, those whose professions
require more social contact, such as the aforementioned nurse,
are often built with more humanlike features, from Butler-style
masks to even a realistic-looking skin. It is also not uncommon
for the owners to equip their longer-serving assistants with
more and more humanlike features as they grow more fond of
them.
Like the nobles who trust their Butlers, many inventors,
engineers and doctors have grown to depend on their
Craftsmen. After all, who would bother dabbling with an
abacus if you have an assistant with a mechanical computer for
a head? Or which doctor would go through his ointment
almanacs if her nurse has them in memory? And the fact they
can assist with the actual work certainly doesn’t hurt either.
