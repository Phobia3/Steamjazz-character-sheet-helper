Careers represent your character’s profession and the skills
required to be successful in it. Each career contains 12 skills
that can be considered essential to the career. You must spend
half of your starting CP to buy ranks in these Career Skills at
character creation. You do not have to purchase ranks in all
career skills if you think your character is not going to need all
of them.
Career names do not necessarily represent the exact profession
of a character; instead, they are broader descriptors for a group
of professions with a similar selection of skills. Most careers
list a number of actual occupations that can be represented by
the career’s skill selection in their description.
