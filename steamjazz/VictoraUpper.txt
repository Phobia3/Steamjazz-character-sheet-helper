Adventuring as Upper Class Victoran:
Some of the upper class Victorans have duties that lead them to
an adventurer’s life, such as diplomatic missions to foreign
countries, working as spies or leading expeditions to conquer
new lands. Business may take some of the more hands-on
industrialists onto long trips and adventures. However, most of
the upper class Victorans who have taken up adventuring are
those youngsters who have gotten tired of the strict regulations
of upper class life and have left it behind to see the world.
Suggested careers: Assassin, Inventor, Journalist, Lawyer,
Officer, Physician, Politician, Scholar, Spy


Typical names:
The Victoran upper class people prefer long, elaborate names.
The differences between northern and southern naming
conventions are less prominent among the upper class, as many
upper class families have merged through marriage across the
whole country. Female names include Annabelle, Eleanora,
Ophelia, Patricia, Ravenna and Seraphimbly, male names include
Alexander, Beaumont, Leonard, Quentin, Radclyffe and
Theodore. Family names are important, and are presented with
pride, as the name carries with it the power behind the
individual. Notable noble surnames include the names of the
ducal families: Charleston, MacLachlan, O’Callaghan and
Neville.
