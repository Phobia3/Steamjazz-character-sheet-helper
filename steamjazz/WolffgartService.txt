The military governs so much of the life in Wulffgart that the
lives of its citizens are largely defined by their military service.
Around 95% of the men and around 70% of the women in
Wulffgart serve their country in military service. The service
takes one year. Men are required to enlist at the age of 16.
Women have the option for non-military service and usually
work as medical help, cooks or aid the army some other way
during this service. If a woman already has children or is
pregnant, she can choose either to postpone her service to a
later date or to be exempt from the service. Men are allowed to
select non-military service only in special cases, such as a
sickness or physical deformity that prevents the man from
effective service, or if the young man is already working for the
good of the nation in another important role, such as a
promising inventor. Only at the end of this one year’s service
does a Wulffgartian become a full citizen. A new citizen
receives a personal identification tattoo to the left wrist (and
possibly chest as well) as well as a military passport that also
functions as a weapon permit.

punishment for desertion is execution by firing squad.
