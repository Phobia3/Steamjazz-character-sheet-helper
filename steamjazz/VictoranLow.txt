Adventuring as a Lower Class Victoran:
It isn’t hard to find reasons for a lower class Victoran to leave
her normal life behind and starting a career as an adventurer.
Almost any alternative would be an improvement to the
monotony of endless labour. If given the chance, many Victoran
lower class people would take up the offer to join a mercenary
group or another adventuring opportunity, but many of the
downtrodden lack the imagination or the ambition to rise above
the squalor that is the only life they have ever known.


Suggested careers: Con Artist, Craftsman, Hunter, Mercenary,
Rogue, Sailor, Scout, Soldier, Warrior


Typical names:
Victoran lower class people have short, typically English
sounding names. Southern Victoran names have a more French
or South European flavour. Female names include Amy, Brett,
Hannah, Katie and Pepper, male names include Ash, Bob, Brad,
Cole, John and Stan. Surnames are simple, and often describe
the family trade or are otherwise descriptive, like Brown, Hill,
Miller, Smith and Tanner.
