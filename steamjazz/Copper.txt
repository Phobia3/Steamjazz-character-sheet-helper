Copper automatons are similar to basic guards, but heavily
specialised in law enforcement. They know the laws of the
land, they know how to enforce them, and they are equipped to
do it and survive. As is the case with human law enforcement
officers, being a Copper is socially a double-edged sword; those
who respect the law have more respect for the Coppers, while
criminals and anarchists can view them as the lowest caste of
the automatons.
While the majority of Coppers are non-decorated basic
automatons by appearance, they can be equipped with more
humanlike features, like those of a Butler, depending on their
duty and purpose. CIC-equipped Coppers can become quite the
crime-solving sleuths, but things being as they are with
automatons, more often than not their human superiors take all
the credit
