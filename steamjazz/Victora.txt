Life in Victora can be very different depending on where you
were born. The social class structure in the feudal Victora is
very rigid. The nobles, nowadays together with rich merchants
and industrialists, direct the country, leaving the common folk
with little freedom of choice. Things are stirring in Victora
though, as rebellion is rising in many areas. The Workers Union
movement is gaining momentum, trying to improve the
working conditions and salary of common workers. The
Women’s Rights movement is also vocal in modern Victora,
and many of the old ways and traditions are being questioned.
Victoran people are generally quite tall and slim of build. Their
skin is fair. Hair colour ranges from pale blonde to almost
black, and especially in the highlands red hair colour is
common. Eye colour ranges from blue to brown. In the northern
duchies blonde hair and blue eyes are more common than in the
southern duchies, where darker complexion is more common.
