Wulffgart went through a major change 16 years ago, when
Tzar Ivan the Fourth was overthrown from power and Marshal
General Friedrich Krause rose to rule the nation. The military
has been leading Wulffgart ever since and changing its political
structure in major ways. most of the lands and wealth of
Wulffgartian nobility was confiscated by the military
government, and the nobles are nowadays little more than
Wulffgartian commoners with glorified titles. Military service
shapes the lives of Wulffgartian people, and many people work
in military duties. The military also controls the industry in
Wulffgart and owns most of the farmlands. From this
standpoint it is hardly surprising that in Wulffgart rebellion is
not brewing among the common folk but among the displaced
nobles and high houses of the old times.
Wulffgartian people are tall and of solid build. They have fair
skin and black or dark brown hair, and their eyes are usually
light to deep dark brown. Living in the far north, people who
have descended from the barbaric northerners have blond hair
and blue eyes.
