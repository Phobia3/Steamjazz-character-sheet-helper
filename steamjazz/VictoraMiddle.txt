Adventuring as Middle Class Victoran: 
Many reasons could encourage a middle class Victoran to start
a career as an adventurer. She could see it as an opportunity to
earn a large amount of wealth quickly in order to improve her
lifestyle and perhaps reach the status as a member of the upper
class. She may wish to break the dull everyday routines of life
at work and get to see the world. Some do it for love, some do
it for hate. Some are driven by betrayal, oath or wager, and
some do it just to experience something new and maybe have
some fun in the meantime.

Typical names:
The Victoran middle class people have a wide variety of names,
mostly somewhat longer English-sounding names than the
lower class. Southern Victoran names have a more French or
Southern European flavour. Female names include Aileen,
Caitlin, Diana, Fanny, Isabel and Perlie, male names include
Alexis, Barney, Eddie, Harold, Jayson and Norbert . Surnames
are usually carried by the families over generations and often
refer to the business or craft of the family or the place from
which they originate, such as Allclock, Blackwood, Taylor and
Wright. Patronymics (although usually from an ancestor from
several generations ago), such as Stevenson, are also common.
